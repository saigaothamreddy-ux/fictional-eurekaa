Here we can define environment initialization functions that
can create interesting types of environments. In case of
Gymnasium environments, please register these functions also
in the generals/__init__.py, so they can be created via gym.make
----------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to add more initializers here. It is a good place
to create "pre-wrapped" envs, or envs with custom maps or other
custom settings.
